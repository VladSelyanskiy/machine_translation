So this is recap where we’re talking about in the previous lecture, remember the notation I defined was that I used this X superscript I, Y superscript I to denote the I training example. And when we’re talking about linear regression or linear least squares, we use this to denote the predicted value of “by my hypothesis H” on the input XI. And my hypothesis was franchised by the vector of grams as theta and so we said that this was equal to some from theta J, si J, and more theta transpose X. And we had the convention that X subscript Z is equal to one so this accounts for the intercept term in our linear regression model. And lowercase n here was the notation I was using for the number of features in my training set. Okay? So in the example when trying to predict housing prices, we had two features, the size of the house and the number of bedrooms. We had two features and there was – little n was equal to two.
