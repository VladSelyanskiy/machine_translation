Then in parts of notation, I guess, I define this term here to be the likelihood of theta. And the likely of theta is just the probability of the data Y, right? Given X and prioritized by theta. To test the likelihood and probability are often confused. So the likelihood of theta is the same thing as the probability of the data you saw. So likely and probably are, sort of, the same thing. Except that when I use the term likelihood I’m trying to emphasize that I’m taking this thing and viewing it as a function of theta.
