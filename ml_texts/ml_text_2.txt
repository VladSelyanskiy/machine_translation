So, in fact – well, if you remember the familiar bell-shaped Gaussian, again, it’s just the ways of associating with these points is that if you imagine putting this on a bell-shaped bump, centered around the position of where you want to value your hypothesis H, then there’s a saying this point here I’ll give a weight that’s proportional to the height of the Gaussian – excuse me, to the height of the bell-shaped function evaluated at this point. And the way to get to this point will be, to this training example, will be proportionate to that height and so on. Okay? And so training examples that are really far away get a very small weight.
