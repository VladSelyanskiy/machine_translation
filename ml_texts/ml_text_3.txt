One last small generalization to this is that normally there’s one other parameter to this algorithm, which I’ll denote as tow. Again, this looks suspiciously like the variants of a Gaussian, but this is not a Gaussian. This is a convenient form or function. This parameter tow is called the bandwidth parameter and informally it controls how fast the weights fall of with distance. Okay? So just copy my diagram from the other side, I guess. So if tow is very small, if that’s a query X, then you end up choosing a fairly narrow Gaussian – excuse me, a fairly narrow bell shape, so that the weights of the points are far away fall off rapidly. Whereas if tow is large then you’d end up choosing a weighting function that falls of relatively slowly with distance from your query.
