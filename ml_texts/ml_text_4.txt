Oh, I guess. Lt’s see. Boy. The weights are not random variables and it’s not, for the purpose of this algorithm, it is not useful to endow it with probable semantics. So you could choose to define things as Gaussian, but it, sort of, doesn’t lead anywhere. In fact, it turns out that I happened to choose this, sort of, bell-shaped function to define my weights. It’s actually fine to choose a function that doesn’t even integrate to one, that integrates to infinity, say, as you’re weighting function. So in that sense, I mean, you could force in the definition of a Gaussian, but it’s, sort of, not useful. Especially since you use other functions that integrate to infinity and don’t integrate to one. Okay? It’s the last question and let’s move on
