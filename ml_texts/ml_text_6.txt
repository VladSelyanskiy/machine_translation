It turns out that there are many assumptions that are sufficient to justify why we do least squares and this is just one of them. So just because I present one set of assumptions under which least squares regression make sense, but this is not the only set of assumptions. So even if the assumptions I describe don’t hold, least squares actually still makes sense in many circumstances. But this sort of new help, you know, give one rationalization, like, one reason for doing least squares regression. And, in particular, what I’m going to do is endow the least squares model with probabilistic semantics. So let’s assume in our example of predicting housing prices, that the price of the house it’s sold four, and there’s going to be some linear function of the features, plus some term epsilon I.
