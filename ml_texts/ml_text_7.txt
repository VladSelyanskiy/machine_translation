One thing that we’ll actually leave is that, in the next lecture notice that the value of sigma squared doesn’t matter, right? That somehow no matter what the value of sigma squared is, I mean, sigma squared has to be a positive number. It’s a variance of a Gaussian. So that no matter what sigma squared is since it’s a positive number the value of theta we end up with will be the same, right? So because minimizing this you get the same value of theta no matter what sigma squared is. So it’s as if in this model the value of sigma squared doesn’t really matter. Just remember that for the next lecture. We’ll come back to this again.
