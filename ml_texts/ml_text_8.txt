In other words, saying goes as that the price of a house given the features of the house and my parameters theta, this is going to be a random variable that’s distributed Gaussian with mean theta transpose XI and variance sigma squared. Right? Because we imagine that the way the housing prices are generated is that the price of a house is equal to theta transpose XI and then plus some random Gaussian noise with variance sigma squared. So the price of a house is going to have mean theta transpose XI, again, and sigma squared, right?
