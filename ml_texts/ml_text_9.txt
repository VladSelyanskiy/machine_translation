Why do I see the error as Gaussian? Two reasons, right? One is that it turns out to be mathematically convenient to do so and the other is, I don’t know, I can also mumble about justifications, such as things to the central limit theorem. It turns out that if you, for the vast majority of problems, if you apply a linear regression model like this and try to measure the distribution of the errors, not all the time, but very often you find that the errors really are Gaussian.
